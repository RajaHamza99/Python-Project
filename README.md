## Project Objective  
The project objective was as follows:  
"To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training."  

In order to meet this requirement, I create a basic application which allows a user to create, read, update and delete playlists.  

As well as meeting the basic CRUD functionality, the project required the following:
<ul>
  <li>Kanban board</li>
  <li>A relational database consisting of at least 2 tables, with a modelled relationship.</li>
  <li>Clear documentation from a design phase describing the architecture used as well as risk assessment.</li>
  <li>A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practises.</li>
  <li>Test suites for the application, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.</li>
  <li>A functioning front-end website using Flask.</li>
  <li>Code integrated into a Version Control System to be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based VM.</li>
  </ul>
  
## App Overview
To meet the CRUD functionality, I have created an application which allows the user to meet the criteria.
  
### Create
A user can create an account for themselves, as well as create any songs, and playlists.  
  
### Read
A user is able to view their created songs, as well as view any created playlists with their songs.  
  
### Update
A user is able to update their playlists, and change the songs within them. They are also able to update their account details.  

### Delete
A user is able to delete both their playlists and songs. They can also delete their account which will delete any playlists and songs created by them.
